# SPM_Work

This is an online food ordering system with otp verification, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The system consists of two main components: the client and the server.

## Client

The client folder contains the front-end part of the application built using React. It includes the user interface and components for the online food ordering system.

### Getting Started

To set up the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
3. rename `Dot_env_file_format_for_client.txt` to `.env` and set your server url in it.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
